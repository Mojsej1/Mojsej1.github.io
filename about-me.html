<h1>Mojsej Azmanov</h1>
<p class="about">Basketball takes a big chunk of my life as I practice it every single day, but I also have other things I like to do during my free time.</p>

<h2>Strengths/Expertises</h2>
<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/basketball-icon.png">
<p><b>Shooting</b></p>
<small>My best skill out of all is my shooting. I can shoot off of a dribble, catch and shoot, and in pick and pops. My shooting FG percentage is 45% while my 3-pt shooting percentage is 40%.</small>
</div>
<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/basketball-icon.png">
<p><b>Dribbling</b></p>
<small>Dribbling is probably the skill I work most on. I dribble a ball for at least 3 hours a day. For a point guard like me dribbling is one of the most crucial skills that I must have and I have it.</small>
</div>
<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/basketball-icon.png">
<p><b>Passing</b></p>
<small>Another key attribute of a point guard is their passing. I am floor facilitator so I like to pass a lot to my open teamates. I avergae 7-8 assists per game and around 35-50 passes per game.</small>
</div>

<h2>Hobbies Outside of Basketball</h2>
<div class="expertise">

<p><b>Exercizing</b></p>
<small>When I am not bouncing a basketball you could catch me in the gym doing push ups and curl ups. I try to excersize at least 4 to 5 times a day to keep myself in good shape.</small>
</div>

<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/reading.jpg" width="200" height="150">
<p><b>Reading</b></p>
<small>I am also quite an enthusiast when it comes to reading. I like to read books a lot and any genre can catch my eye: mysteries, actions, or thrillers.</small>
</div>

<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/music.jpg" width="200" height="150">
<p><b>Music</b></p>
<small>If I am having a bad day, I always whip out my sweet mp4 touch coral and put some bangers on it. I like hip-hop and rap, but lately I have been listening to quite a bit of Jazz.</small>
</div>

<h2>Facts about me</h2>
<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/sleep.jpg" width="200" height="150">
<p><b>Sleep</b></p>
<small>I value my sleep a lot. If I am not getting 8-10 hours of sleep a day I won't be able to function properly. Sometimes I can even go into hibernation for a whole day with just sleeping</small>
</div>

<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/salad.jpg" width="200" height="150">
<p><b>Dieting</b></p>
<small>I take very good care of myself when it comes to healthy eating. I always try to make the healthy choice between different meals. Mostly I eat protein and salads with little carbs</small>
</div>

<div class="expertise">
<img src="images/boss.jpg" width="200" height="150">
<p><b>Nickname</b></p>
<small>My nickname on the basketball court is the boss. My teamates made that name up for me so I just stuck to it. It does sound pretty good though.</small>
